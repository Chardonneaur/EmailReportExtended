# Matomo EmailReportExtended Plugin

## Description

This community plugin allows you to change the default row number displayed on the Email report. By default it is set on 23 within the config file. The issue is that not all super user can have a direct access to the server. So this plugin is solving this issue by giving you a back end where to make this configuration.
This plugin has been jointly developed with Ronan Chardonneau and Lukas Winkler.
